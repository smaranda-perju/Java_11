# Java_11

- I created a Spring Boot project containing the REST services for comunicating with a database.

- The project contains the following classes: Player, Game, PlayerController, AddPlayerRequest, ModifyPlayerRequest.

- PlayerController contains methods for: obtaining the list of the players (via a HTTP GET request), adding a new player in the database (via a HTTP POST request), modifying the name of a player (via a HTTP PUT request), deleting a player (via a HTTP DELETE request).
